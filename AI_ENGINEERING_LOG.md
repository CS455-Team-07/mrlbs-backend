# AI Engineering Log

This log records meaningful AI-assisted engineering work on the MRLBS backend. Entries are added chronologically according to the workflow in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). Exact prompts and outputs are recorded when available; otherwise, the entry must state that limitation and provide a faithful summary. The human team member is responsible for evaluating each entry.

No historical entries are included because no prior AI engineering log entries were present in the repository.

#### 2026-10-07 — Admin resource onboarding

**Task / Context:**\
Implement FR-2.1 / US-2 so administrators can create and persist lab resources with their initial booking rules.

**Prompt:**\
Exact user prompt: “implement this jira ticket” followed by the ticket titled “Admin onboards a new resource (name, type, location, capacity, initial rules)” and its description, acceptance criteria, and traceability to FR-2.1 / US-2.

**AI Output:**\
Added a resource creation API, JPA persistence model and Flyway migration, a backend `ROLE_ADMIN` method guard, and an Admin form in the frontend. This entry summarizes the generated work; the exact code is in the files listed below.

**Student/Team Evaluation:**\
Pending human review. The repository currently has no identity provider or role provisioning, so an authentication integration must supply `ROLE_ADMIN` before an Admin can successfully call the endpoint.

**Errors / Risks / Hallucinations:**\
The pre-existing scaffold has no authentication/authorization provider. Role enforcement is implemented at the resource endpoint, but end-to-end Admin sign-in and role assignment are an integration dependency.

**Changes Made After Evaluation:**\
No human evaluation has been provided yet. The endpoint validates non-empty initial rules and persists them in order; capacity is optional and positive when present.

**Final Accepted Artifact:**\
Proposed implementation in `src/main/java/com/mrlbs/resource`, `src/main/java/com/mrlbs/controller/ResourceController.java`, `src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__create_resources.sql`, and the frontend Admin dashboard. Human acceptance is pending.

**Decision:**\
Modified; implementation prepared for human review.

**Reason:**\
The request was implemented within the existing scaffold. End-to-end authentication cannot be completed without choosing/configuring an identity provider and role source.
